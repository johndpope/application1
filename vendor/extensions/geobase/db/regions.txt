The yellowhammer nickname was applied to the Confederate soldiers from Alabama when a company of young cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, under the command of Rev. D.C. Kelly, arrived at Hopkinsville, KY, where Gen. Forrest's troops were stationed. The officers and men of the Huntsville company wore fine, new uniforms, whereas the soldiers who had long been on the battlefields were dressed in faded, worn uniforms. On the sleeves, collars and coattails of the new calvary troop were bits of brilliant yellow cloth. As the company rode past Company A , Will Arnett cried out in greeting Yellowhammer, Yellowhammer, flicker, flicker! The greeting brought a roar of laughter from the men and from that moment the Huntsville soldiers were spoken of as the yellowhammer company. The term quickly spread throughout the Confederate Army and all Alabama troops were referred to unofficially as the Yellowhammers.

The Golden State Museum is also the name of a new museum slated to open in late 1998 at the California State Archives in Sacramento. The museum's exhibits will bring to life the momentous events of California's history through a series of innovative, interpretive exhibits.

2964	US-CT	Connecticut	\N	1	1	\N	Qui transtulit sustinet (He who transplanted still sustains)	Mountain laurel	Robin	The Constitution State	Connecticut was designated the “Constitution State” by the General Assembly in 1959. As early as the 19th Century, John Fiske, a popular historian from Connecticut, made the claim that the Fundamental Orders of 1638/39 were the first written constitution in history. Some contemporary historians dispute Fiske's analysis. However, Simeon E. Baldwin, a former Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, defended Fiske's view of the Fundamental Orders in Osborn's History of Connecticut in Monographic Form by stating that never had a company of men deliberately met to frame a social compact for immediate use, constituting a new and independent commonwealth, with definite officers, executive and legislative, and prescribed rules and modes of government, until the first planters of Connecticut came together for their great work on January 14th, 1638-9. The text of the Fundamental Orders is reproduced in Section I of this volume and the original is on permanent display at the Museum of Connecticut History at the State Library. Connecticut has also been known as the “Nutmeg State”, the “Provisions State”, and the “Land of Steady Habits”.

1945	US-MI	Michigan	\N	1	1	\N	Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice (If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look around you)	Apple Blossom	American Robin	The Great Lakes State	Some people believe that Ohioans gave Michigan the nickname “The Wolverine State” around 1835 during a dispute over the Toledo strip, a piece of land along the border between Ohio and Michigan. Rumors in Ohio at the time described Michiganians as being as vicious and bloodthirsty as wolverines. This dispute became known as the Toledo War. Another reason given for the nickname is a story that has Native Americans, during the 1830s, comparing Michigan settlers to wolverines. Some native people, according to this story, disliked the way settlers were taking the land because it made them think of how the gluttonous wolverine went after its food. Another nickname for Michigan is the “Great Lake State.” Michigan's shores touch four of the five Great Lakes, and Michigan has more than 11,000 inland lakes. In Michigan, you are never more than 6 miles from an inland lake or more than 85 miles from a Great Lake. From 1969 to 1975 and from 1977 to 1983 Michigan's automobile license plates featured the legend, GREAT LAKE STATE.

The name is derived from the nickname for the University of Nebraska athletic teams - the Cornhuskers - which was coined in 1900 by Charles S. Cy Sherman, a sportswriter for the Nebraska State Journal in Lincoln. Cornhuskers replaced earlier nicknames, such as Golden Knights, Antelopes, and Bugeaters. The term cornhusker comes from the method of harvesting or husking corn by hand, which was common in Nebraska before the invention of husking machinery. source: http://visitnebraska.org/nefacts/

This name is a direct reference to the history and beauty of New Mexico. Land of Enchantment was officially adopted as the nickname of New Mexico in the year 1990. It had previously been used as the title for a book, which was written in 1906 by Lillian Whiting. The book title caught on and was soon used to promote the state as a great tourist destination.
1357	US-NY	New York	\N	1	1	\N	Excelsior (Ever upward)	Rose	Bluebird	The Empire State	no historian knows exactly where the Empire State nickname originated. Some have speculated that the name sprang from George Washington, who referred to New York as at present the seat of the Empire in a 1784 letter. Others believe the nickname denotes New York State's wealth, natural resources, and liberty-loving citizens. George Washington rightly envisioned New York State as the seat of the Empire. Geographically, the state was the springboard from which independence and westward expansion began. Politically, New York stood firm for the cause of independence and arose as an example of temerity under attack. New York's wealth of natural resources such as abundant water, fertile soil and rich timberland enriched the other U.S. states as they grew. Wise and talented statesmen built New York into the Empire State as well including Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt.
1256	US-NC	North Carolina	\N	1	1	\N	Esse quam videri (To be rather than to seem)	American Dogwood	Cardinal	The Tar Heel State	he U.S. state North Carolina's nickname, Tar Heel State, most likely originates from the state's most prosperous industry from 1720 to 1870: the manufacture of tar for naval vessels. North Carolina's abundant pine forests provided a seemingly endless supply of pine pitch. When the logs were buried with soil and burned, sticky resin oozed from the wood, which was then collected and sold to the English navy. Before the American War for Independence, North Carolina supplied much of the naval tar necessary for English ships. Since then, other legends and anecdotes have arisen to explain the Tar Heel State nickname, including a Civil War story regarding Robert E. Lee.
1202	US-ND	North Dakota	\N	1	1	\N	Liberty and union, now and forever: one and inseparable	Wild Prairie Rose	Western Meadowlark	The Peace Garden State	North Dakota is most likely known as The Peace Garden State because it partially houses the International Peace Garden, which overlaps the international border between the United States (US) and Canada. Part of the garden is in the US state of North Dakota, while part of it is in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The garden was established in 1932 to commemorate the lasting state of peaceful affairs between these two nations. The state's department of motor vehicles is credited with stimulating the dedication of The Peace Garden State as North Dakota's official state nickname, since they placed this slogan on the state's car license plates in 1956. Residents of the state liked the sound of The Peace Garden State so much that North Dakota's legislative body designated this the official state nickname one year later, in 1957.
119	\N	Ohio	\N	2	1	98	With God all things are possible	Scarlet Carnation	Cardinal	The Buckeye State	Ohio's decision to call itself the Buckeye State is a natural choice. The hardy tree with the distinctive seeds used to dot much of the landscape during the colonial acquisition of this territory, and it still does. Adding to the symbolic weight of the name, the Indian word for buckeye nuts, hetuk or buck eye, was once applied by the local Indians to an early pioneer as a seemingly sincere term of endearment. Colonists began to settle the Northwest Territories in the late 18th century, landing at the first outpost in what is now Marietta, Ohio. One of that city's founders, Ebenezer Sproat, reportedly became known as Hetuck to the natives. Some historians believe this is the first connection of Ohio to the nickname Buckeye State. Though historians often note that this was due to Sproat's tall stature and popularity with the Indians, it is perhaps important to note that the buckeye tree's other nickname is fetid buckeye for the rotting smell it emits when its twigs or leaves are broken, despite all pleasant appearances. Also, the tree's eye-like nuts are toxic to livestock and humans alike.
1033	US-OK	Oklahoma	\N	1	1	\N	Labor omnia vincit (Labor conquers all things)	Mistletoe	Scissor-tailed Flycatcher	The Sooner State	Oklahoma, one of the central states in the United States, has the nickname The Sooner State. Oklahoma's Sooner State nickname refers to a group of people who claimed terrain in a tract of land known as the Unassigned Lands before it was considered legal to stake claims. These people were referred to as sooners, a name derived directly from the sooner clause in the Indian Appropriation Act of 2 March 1889. This clause revoked the land rights of any settler who entered the Oklahoma Territory before the area was legally open. Originally, the term sooner carried a negative connotation of a lawless thief, but the derogatory meaning has gradually improved since the University of Oklahoma football team adopted this name in 1908.
996	US-OR	Oregon	\N	1	1	\N	Alis volat Propriis (She flies with her own wings) (1987)	Oregon Grape	Western Meadowlark	The Beaver State	The American Beaver (Castor canadensis) was named Oregon state animal by the 1969 Legislature. Prized for its fur, the beaver was overtrapped by early settlers and eliminated from much of its original range. Through proper management and partial protection, the beaver has been reestablished in watercourses throughout the state and remains an important economic asset. The beaver has been referred to as nature's engineer, and its dam-building activities are important to natural water flow and erosion control. Oregon is known as the “Beaver State” and Oregon State University's athletic teams are called the Beavers. 
926	US-PA	Pennsylvania	\N	1	1	\N	Virtue, liberty, and independence	Mountain Laurel	Ruffed Grouse	The Keystone State	The word keystone comes from architecture and refers to the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place. Some people believe the nickname, the Keystone State, originated from the time when the states were voting for their independence from Britain. Pennsylvania had nine delegates in the Continental Congress. Some sources hold that the Pennsylvania delegates were divided: four delegates were for independence and four delegates were against becoming independent. The final vote went to John Morton, and he voted in favor of independence. His vote, and consequently, Pennsylvania’s vote to move toward independence have been called the keystone vote or the vote in support of the new government.
841	US-RI	Rhode Island	\N	1	1	\N	Hope	Violet	Rhode Island Red	The Ocean State	Rhode Island is a state in the New England region of the eastern United States. Known as the smallest state in the union, Rhode Island is also known for its beautiful coastline, which is dotted with small islands. As a result, it is sometimes called the Ocean State, a nickname that fits it well. Of all the states in the US, Rhode Island has the longest ratio of coastline to overall square mileage. Despite being only 37 miles (60 kilometers) wide and 48 miles (77 kilometers) long, the Ocean State has a total coastline of 400 miles (644 kilometers). This is in large part because of the 30 islands dotted around Narragansett Bay in the east of the State. In fact, the bays, inlets, and sounds make up more than 30 percent of the state’s total area. This means that all residents of Rhode Island — even those in the northwestern corner of the state — are never more than an hour’s drive from the Atlantic coast.
794	US-SC	South Carolina	\N	1	1	\N	Animis opibusque parati (Prepared in mind and resources) and Dum spiro spero (While I breathe, I hope)	Yellow Jessamine	Great Carolina Wren	The Palmetto State	South Carolina is referred to as the Palmetto State because its official tree is the sabal palmetto. This tree is commonly referred to as the cabbage palm and the palmetto palm. Sabal palmetto grows in the sand filled flatlands in South Carolina and has historical importance dating back to the Revolutionary War. After South Carolina seceded from the Union in 1861, the sabal palmetto became a part of the South Carolina's flag.
727	US-SD	South Dakota	\N	1	1	\N	Under God the people rule	Pasque Flower	Ring-necked Pheasant	Mount Rushmore State	South Dakota, a state in the north central continental United States, is known as the Mount Rushmore State. This stems from the presence of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial near the city of Keystone in western South Dakota. This enormous memorial to four American presidents, completed in 1941, features their faces and partial busts, each 60 feet (18 m) high and carved from the granite of Mount Rushmore. Famous even before its completion in 1941, when finished, this memorial quickly became an icon of American culture and patriotism and gained the state of South Dakota much fame. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial was commissioned and begun in 1927. Gutzon Borglum was the sculptor of this massive tribute to Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and he employed a crew of over 400 workers to transform the mountain face. When completed, the monument was dedicated as a National Memorial and was eventually placed under the supervision of the United States Department of the Interior's National Park Service.
631	US-TN	Tennessee	\N	1	1	\N	Agriculture and Commerce (1987)	Iris	Mockingbird	The Volunteer State	By most accounts, Tennessee first earned its nickname as the volunteer state during the War of 1812 due to the large numbers of Tennesseans who volunteered to serve in battle against Great Britain. Although the men never faced battle, General Andrew Jackson brought the soldiers home at his own expense. Later, Jackson led 2000 Tennessee volunteer soldiers in a successful battle against the British in 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans. Following such success, as many as 30,000 Tennesseans again volunteered in the Mexican War.
376	US-TX	Texas	\N	1	1	\N	Friendship	Bluebonnet	Mockingbird	The Lone Star State	The first state nickname of Texas is “The Lone Star State.” This nickname is derived from the lone star, a symbol that is synonymous with the state of Texas. A single white star is depicted on the flag of Texas. There is also a star on the state seal. The significance of the white star to the state of Texas is its representation of the arduous road to independence from Mexico. Texan troops used a flag with a big white star during their many battles with Mexican troops during the course of the war.
346	US-UT	Utah	\N	1	1	\N	Industry	Sego lily	Common American Gull	The Beehive State	Utah is referred to as the Beehive State due to the symbol of the beehive being associated with the state, including its use on the state flag. The beehive is considered to be synonymous with industry and perseverance, since bees are famously hard workers, toiling almost endlessly for the well being of the hive and the bees living within it. Similarly, the early settlers in Utah, primarily members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the LDS Church and Mormon Church, saw the beehive as the perfect symbol to indicate their industriousness and hard work. This association with hard work and the industriousness of bees is also why the state motto is “Industry.”

Called the “Mother State” because it was the first state to be colonized. 
31	\N	Washington	\N	2	1	25	Al-Ki (Indian word meaning “by and by”)	Coast Rhododendron	Willow Goldfinch	The Evergreen State	Washington is called the Evergreen State due to its physical geography and climate. Much of this state's terrain is made up of deep green forests of pine and fir trees. Large amounts of annual rainfall account for the state's richly green landscapes. This state nickname is also sometimes attributed to Washington's plentiful national parks and protected wildlife preserves. The prominence of deep green is apparent in some of Washington's other state symbols such as the color of its flag.  The origins of Washington's state nickname can be traced to the late 19th century when the state first became an official part of the United States. A real estate professional named Charles T. Conover suggested the moniker Evergreen State in 1890 as a tribute to the green landscapes that were visible from his home in Seattle. The Washington state legislature officially signed the nickname into law in 1893. Some residents occasionally refer to their state with the unofficial nickname of the Green Tree State, although this name is usually not as well known. Frequent rainy weather is a notable contributing factor to Washington becoming nicknamed the Evergreen State. This state has one of the highest levels of annual precipitation in the United States (US), as an average year in Washington state sees around 160 inches (about 407 cm) of rain. 
98	US-WV	West Virginia	\N	1	1	\N	Montani semper liberi (Mountaineers are always free)	Rhododendron	Cardinal	The Mountain State	West Virginia has three acknowledged nicknames, but only one of them, The Mountain State, is official, following adoption by state lawmakers. The nickname comes from the fact that the state is home to a section of the Allegheny Mountains. The Allegheny Mountains comprise a little more than 10 percent of the land area in the Mountain State. Colonists began to populate the mountains in the mid-1700s. No less than seven recreation areas dot the landscape, including the Monongahela National Forest.
25	US-WI	Wisconsin	\N	1	1	\N	Forward	Wood Violet	Robin	The Badger State	Unlike most of the other states that are named after animals, the nickname for the state of Wisconsin is not due to the animal it is named after being abundant in its territorial borders. One of the state nicknames of Wisconsin is “The Badger State.” This nickname is not a direct reference to the presence of the animals in the state. Rather, the nickname is a consequence of the behavior of the early settlers. The appellation “The Badger State” is an indirect reference to the behavior of badgers, while describing that of the miners. 
1	US-WY	Wyoming	\N	1	1	\N	Equal Rights	Indian Paintbrush	Western Meadowlark	The Cowboy State	The state of Wyoming has several nicknames, one of which is “The Cowboy State.” The state earned this name due to the many ranches in its borders. Another reason behind the nickname is the adoption of the image of a cowboy perched on a bucking horse as the state symbol. The history behind the proliferation of cattle and, consequently, cowboys is an interesting one. The early emigrants and settlers in the states of Oregon, Utah and California often traveled with all of their possessions and livestock with which they hoped to make a new life for themselves in the new states.
